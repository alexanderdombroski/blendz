# Overview

I chose to do an e-commerce website because it is easily expandable to many different skills of web development. I've improved at React, managing state, dynamically loading in data, TypeScript. I've learned how to pull smoothie data and ingredients from a Firebase database.

I hope to eventually expand the website to send receipts via email after a purchase and allow the user to build a custom smoothie. 

The [site](https://blendz.vercel.app/) is hosted on vercel. The database updates will come live very soon, but for now they can be viewed in a demo video.
